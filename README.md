# DoorDash_Product_Management
UDACITY PRODUCT MANAGER NANODEGREE PROJECTS


This repository consists of all projects done as part of Udacity's Product Manager nanodegree. I have taken the case study of Doordash, a leading food delivery chain in USA, introducing robots for their delivery operations. The idea is to come up with a tool for the operations team to manage the robots remotely until the robot gets fully autonomous. 

**Pre-conditions given:** Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required. My team has been tasked with building a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).

**Project1: Pitch a Product Vision** 
- To create a business case: 
  - Identifying problems to solve by creating a compelling story using evidence and metrics
  - Identify the opportunity by calculating the total addressable market (TAM) for the product
  - Create a proposal by defining product use cases and targer users
  - Calculate ROI / return of interest
  - Define success metrics
- Identify the competitors in the market:
  - Compare the features of competitor products/solutions
  - Show the advantage of our product by defining product positioning and opportunity in the market
- Create Roadmap and vision:
  - Define and craft compelling vision and strategy
  - Build a roadmap around the identified strategic areas
- Create a compelling presentation covering all the above

**Project2: Run a Design Sprint** 
- To create an initial draft of PRD ( Product Requirements document) including background info about the industry, problem to solve, Goals and success metrics
- 'Understand' phase of design sprint: To follow the “How Might We” model to identify problems, clustering and selecting a strategic theme
- 'Define' phase of design sprint: To create a future press release or tweets
- 'Sketch' phase of design sprint: idea brainstorming, 8 quick sketches and 2 detailed sketches for the most valuable solution
- 'Decide' phase of design sprint: To narrow all possible ideas down to a final, single idea to move into the next step
- 'Prototype' phase of design sprint: To create a storyboard including atleast 7 frames, To design a prototype using Figma
- 'validate' phase of design sprint: To write a research plan, To conduct user interviews
- 'iterate' phase of desgin sprint: To update prototype based on feedback from user interviews and to conduct a final user interview
- Finally add all detailed feature reuquirements as part of PRD with their priorities

**Project3: Manage the product development process** 

**Pre-conditions given:**
The solution requires directions and distance between robot and destination ( could be restaurant/delivery address). The engineering lead shared (Google Distance Matrix API) and (Google Direction API) as a reference to what information would be available when you leverage Doordash API to build. Reviewing the documentation, PM noticed that walking and bicycle information is available via the API with rich attributes that can be leveraged to help the Operations team in multiple ways

- To create Project Blueprint by creating Coordination Activities Map
- To plan for sprint meeting: To identify sprint Goal,To prioritize Backlog containing user stories with detailed acceptance criteria, To write user stories that includes a detailed acceptance criteria (also called “definition of done”) which will be used to develop and test by the scrum team.
- To gain insights from API documentation and refine solution and design (if needed) and to identify a clear list of questions to the engineering team that aid feasibility discussion/decisions
- To reprioritize sprint backlog based on different scenarios and to handle potentially difficult situations

**Project4: Launch the product to the market** 
- To update PRD to identify the users, the problem and the product, TAM, size of the competitors
- To identify the marketing and pricing strategy, to determine acquisition channels
- To prepare for the launch by developing pre-launch checklist, risk planning, provide training plan for sales, customer support and technical writers, to create user guide
- As part of post launch activity, create hypothesis testing for the problem identified from post launch user feedback and finally write launch email to the organization
